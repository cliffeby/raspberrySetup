$ node -v
v8.7.0
We see that we are running Node 8.7.0 and we really want to be running Node 9.x.  We want to stay on the cutting edge rather than fading into obsolescence.  ??

Let’s update our package repository to use the latest version of Node which is Node 9.4.0 by using the setup_9.x script from NodeSource.

$ curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_9.x | sudo -E bash -
In addition to updating your package repository, the setup script that runs in the previous command also invokes a sudo apt update command as one of its final steps.  Once again, the  sudo apt update command does not actually update any software on the system, but will download the latest package lists from the software repositories so that Raspbian will be aware of all new software available along with dependencies.

We are now ready to upgrade our current version of Node.js to the latest version.  We use the “apt install” command which will upgrade the package even though it is already installed.  Please note that “apt install” will install the latest version of Node that is available in a given Node branch.  For example, if you are using the setup_9.x script, the most recent version of Node 9.x will be installed.

$ sudo apt install nodejs
When we now request the current version of Node running, we see a more recent version of Node running so we can declare victory!  The old Node version is replaced and no longer running on the machine.
