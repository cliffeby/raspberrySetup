This failled see below for what worked
_______________________________________
get http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
There are some NPM native modules like node-native-keymap that didn't work when I built the first time, so you'll need some supporting libraries first:

sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
Then, from my Raspberry Pi, I did this to build my own instance of VS Code.

git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vscode
cd vscode
./scripts/npm.sh install --arch=armhf
This took the Raspberry Pi 3 about 20 minutes so be patient.

Then, run your instance with ./scripts/code.sh from that same folder.

This worked - New version of Raspian

1) Install GPG key

Ctrl-X, Y, enter to exit 'nano' and save the updated file.

3) Install VS Code (code-oss)
Code: Select all

sudo apt-get update
